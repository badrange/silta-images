# Modified Mailhog

Docker mailhog image based on official mailhog image, with extra modifications.

## Log suppression

Our deployments receive a steady flow of mailhog log messages that are normally irrelevant (because it just works) and it generates unnecessary noise. We use [mailhog chart by codecentric](https://github.com/codecentric/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/mailhog) to deploy mailhog, but [there's no way to suppress logs](https://github.com/codecentric/helm-charts/pull/272) other than overriding entrypoint currently. Our solution to this is to replace entrypoint in the Docker image and overriding the image source in helm chart.
